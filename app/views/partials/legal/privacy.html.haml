Privacy Policy

Playedby.me (“Playedby.me”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of http://played-by-me.herokuapp.com/ (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Playedby.me Terms of Service, accessible at http://playedby.me/terms/.
As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site (together, the “Playedby.me Services”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Services (as defined in the Terms of Service).

Personally Identifiable Information.
We collect your Personal Information in connection with your registration to join our Playedby.me Services. As used herein, “Personal Information” means information that can be used to contact or identify you. You may register to join the Playedby.me Services by providing us with Personal Information we request of you to create your Playedby.me Account. We will extract the Personal Information you have provided to Facebook (such as your “real” name, email address, birthday, gender and other information you make publicly available via Facebook) from the account you have with Facebook and use that information to create your Playedby.me Account; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with Facebook. Other than what we may share with Facebook as described below, the Personal Information Facebook has about you is obtained by Facebook independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other services you use.
We also collect the other information that we extract as part of registration and personalization of your use of the Playedby.me Services (e.g., without limitation, age, gender, zip code (on its own), songs or content you access via the Playedby.me Services and individual preferences) ("Non-Identifying Information").
We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Playedby.me Services and administer your inquiries.
Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your individual preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Playedby.me Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Playedby.me Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Playedby.me Services are used.
We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Playedby.me newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

Log Data
When you use the Site and Playedby.me Services, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Playedby.me User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and Playedby.me Services and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor them to our visitors’ needs. For example, we use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, except as otherwise provided herein, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

Cookies
As is standard practice on many websites, our Site uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Playedby.me Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Playedby.me Services and then close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Playedby.me Services.

Phishing
Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Playedby.me. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login information or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
Playedby.me Members. When you register to use the Playedby.me Services, other Members will see your name, the songs you have added to a playlist via Playedby.me Services, the playlists you have joined via Playedby.me Services, the songs you hearted via Playedby.me Services, and the votes you have made for a song via Playedby.me Serbices. Other Members will also be able to listen to the music you have uploaded via the Playedby.me Services.
Playedby.me Business Partners. We may also provide Non-Identifying Information and Log Data to our business partners or other trusted entities for demographic profiling and other purposes. For example, we may share your IP address, age, gender, and music you listened to on the Playedby.me Services for purposes of industry analysis. Any information shared with such partners and entities will not contain your Personal Information.
Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Playedby.me Services, to provide the Playedby.me Services on our behalf, to perform Site (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, payment processing services, web analytics and improvement of the Site and Application’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site, Application and Playedby.me Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Social Networking SItes. As a Member, you may link your Playedby.me Account with certain Social Networking Sites where you have an existing account with the Social Networking Site. In these instances, with your permission and on your behalf, we will share information related to your activities on the Site with the applicable Social Networking Site.
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Playedby.me cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Playedby.me or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
Business Transfers. Playedby.me may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
Changing or Deleting your Personal Information
All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their Playedby.me Accounts by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your Playedby.me Account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at team@playedby.me with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
Security
Playedby.me is very concerned with safeguarding your information. The security of your personal information is important to us. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number ) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In some cases, we also encrypt sensitive information where it is stored on our systems.
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Playedby.me transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
Links to Other Sites
Our Site may contain links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

Our Policy Toward Children
The Site and Application are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at team@playedby.me. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
